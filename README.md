# Description
Influenced by the good experiences from JSF (Java Server Faces) with regard to
function and an easy integration into the markup, arose a similar client-side
fullstack solution.

Seanox aspect-js focuses on a minimalist approach to implementing
Single-Page Applications (SPAs). This framework takes the declarative approach
of HTML and extends this with expression language, reactivity rendering with
additional attributes, object/model binding, Model View Controller, Resource
Bundle, NoSQL datasource, test environment and much more.


# Features
- Easy integration in markup and JavaScript (clean code)
- Lightweight implementation (requires no additional frameworks)
- Easy to integrate and combine with other JavaScript frameworks  
  if the frameworks do not do the same or use the same syntax
- Component based architecture
- Modularization (supports imports at the runtime)  
  component concept for smart/automatic loading of composite resources
- Event handling
- Expression Language  
  meta-language extension with full JavaScript support
- Reactivity rendering  
  Rendering reacts to changes in data objects and triggers partial rendering on
  consumers
- Markup rendering  
  supports: condition, custom tags, events, filter, interval, iterate,
  rendering, resources messages, validation, ...
- Markup hardening  
  makes it difficult to manipulate the attributes in the markup  
  non-visible components are removed from the DOM and only reinserted when used  
- Model View Controller (MVC) / Model View ViewModel (MVVM)  
  supports: events, virtual paths, sitemap, permission concept, ...
- Resource Bundle / Resource Messages  
  localization, internationalization (i18n) and text outsourcing 
- NoSQL datasource based on XML  
  lightweight data management for aggregation / projection / transformation
- Test environment  
  for automated unit tests and integration tests
- ...
