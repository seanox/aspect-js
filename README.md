# Description
Influenced by the good experiences from JSF (Java Server Faces) with regard to
function and an easy integration into the markup, arose a similar client-side
fullstack solution.  
Seanox aspect-js focuses on a minimalist approach to implementing
Single-Page Applications (SPAs). 
This framework takes the declarative approach of HTML and extends this with
expression language, rendering with addional attributes, object/model-binding,
Model View Controller, Resource Bundle, NoSQL datasource, test environment and
much more.


# Features
- Easy integration in markup and JavaScript (clean code)
- Lightweight implementation (requires no additional frameworks)  
  less than 64kB for all (so the plan, but there will be a few more bytes)
- Component based architecture
- Modularization (supports imports at the runtime)  
  component concept for smart/automatic loading of composite resources
- Event handling
- Expression Language  
  simple meta-language extension in combination with full JavaScript
- Markup rendering  
  supports: condition, custom tags, events, filter, interval, iterate, rendering,
  resources messages, validation, ...
- Model View Controller  
  supports: events, virtual paths, sitemap, permission concept, ...
- Resource Bundle / Resource Messages  
  for localization and internationalization as well for the outsourcing of texts 
- NoSQL datasource based on XML
- Test environment  
  something like JUnit for automated tests
- ...
