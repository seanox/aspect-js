# Introduction


## What is Seanox aspect-js?

Influenced by the good experiences from JSF (Java Server Faces) with regard to
function and an easy integration into the markup, arose a similar client-side
fullstack solution.  
Seanox aspect-js focuses on a minimalist approach to implementing
Single-Page Applications (SPAs).   
This framework takes the declarative approach of HTML and extends this with
expression language, rendering with addional attributes, object/model-binding,
Model View Controller, Resource Bundle, NoSQL datasource, test environment and
much more.


## Getting Started

The framework consists of pure JavaScript.

The releases consist of one file that can be downloaded or integrated via a
release channel.  
The release channels continuously provide the newest final major versions, which
are downward compatible to the major version. Seanox aspect-js is always up to
date when using the release channels.
 
Each release consists of two versions. The development version contains comments
on conception, function and usage. The production version is optimized in size
but not obfuscated.

Create an HTML file, such as _index.html_ and include Seanox apect-js via the
release channel.

```html
<!-- development version, includes helpful comments -->
<script src="https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/raw/master/releases/aspect-js-1.x.js"></script>
```

or

```html
<!-- production version, optimized in size but not obfuscated -->
<script src="https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js/raw/master/releases/aspect-js-1.x-min.js"></script>
```
