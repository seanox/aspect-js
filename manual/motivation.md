# Motivation
The separation of web applications into frontend and backend as well as the use
of browser-based rich clients and microservices is more than just a trend. In
addition to the strict separation of components, scalability and modularization
are good arguments for this type of application architecture.

The amount of frameworks for browser-based rich clients is huge. They differ in
functionality, complexity, size and sometimes require their own compilers and
servers.

Seanox aspect-js focuses on a minimalist approach. Influenced by the good
experiences with JSF (Java Server Faces) in regard to function and an easy
integration into the markup, the idea arose for a similar client-side solution
and as an experiment to understand reactive rendering, expression language and
performance.
