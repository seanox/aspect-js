## Server
The project contains a completely preconfigured web server, which can be started
and also terminated most simply by command line from the project directory with
the included Ant script.

```
ant -f ./development/build.xml run
```
```
ant -f ./development/build.xml stop
```

The following important addresses are configured:

| Adresse                          | Usage                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| http://127.0.0.1:8000/           | Test environment                   |
| http://127.0.0.1:8000/test       | Test environment with context path |
| http://127.0.0.1:8000/playground | Playground                         |
| http://127.0.0.1:8000/tutorial   | Tutorials                          |

Logging is configured to use the command line for output.

The web server is configured via `./server/devwex.ini`. Changes take effect
immediately and the web server restarts automatically.

## Build
The release is created by Ant script directly from the root directory of the
project.

```
ant -f ./develpoment/build.xml test
```

## Test
Before a release, all tests in all relevant browser engines must run
successfully.

### Firewall
- Windows Defender Firewall (add a rule)
- Name: Seanox Development TCP 8000
- Protocol Type: TCP
- Local Port: 8000
- Remote Port: all
- Remote IP Address: subnet

Creation of the rule via command line:

```
set rule_name=Seanox Development TCP 8000
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="%rule_name%"
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule^
    name="%rule_name%"^
    dir=in protocol=tcp localport=8000 localip=any^
    remoteip=localsubnet profile=any action=allow
```

For more details see here:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule -?
```

| Goanna | https://www.palemoon.org/download.shtml                             |
| WebKit | not available, native integration required<br>e.g. Safari iOS/MacOS |

### Procedure
- Create a release
  `ant -f ./develpoment/build.xml test`
- Start the server
  `ant -f ./develpoment/build.xml run`
- URLs to be tested
  http://127.0.0.1:8000  
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html    
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/test  
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/test/index.html  
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/tutorial  
- Broweser to be tested  
  MS Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox, Palemoon, Safari iOS, Safari MacOS

## Release

### GitHub
- Check that all ToDo's are done
- Run all tests in all Engines (Blink, Gecko, Goanna, WebKit)
- Finalize `CHANGES` and `README.md`
- Create a release
- Publish the release with a tag
- Create a release in GitHub for the tag
- Update the tutorial and create a release there too

### npmjs.com
- Go to the project directory
- Update the file `package.json`
- Log in with your credentials: `npm login`
- Publish the version: `npm publish --access public`
- In case the old version should be deprecated:  
  e.g. `npm deprecate seanox/aspect-js@"< 1.4.0" "WARNING: This version has been updated to 1.4.0."`

### cdn.jsdelivr.net
Nothing needs to be changed here, the content is synchronized with npmjs.com.

## Playground
Playground is used for quick testing and bug analysis with the current sources,
even without creating a build, because the components are used individually as a
link.

http://127.0.0.1:8000/playground

To use it, the [server](#server) must be started.
