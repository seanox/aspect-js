// The spinner is registered for the change from the URL hash.

// As modules are only loaded once, we do not need to check anything else.

// Due to the reflow and repaint of the browser, a very early event such as
// popstate must be used for activation so that the changes to the spinner
// attribute take effect before the change from the hash.

// Because everything is very fast, you can use network throttling in the
// browser to see the spinner.

// The event popstate occurs when the active history entry changes, i.e. also
// when the link to the current page is clicked. In this case, rendering is not
// triggered and the EVENT_RENDER_END event does not occur. This is why the
// history change is activated when the spinner is enabled.
