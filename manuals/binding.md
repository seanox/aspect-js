# View-Module Binding
View-Module Binding is the mechanism used by Seanox aspect-js to connect a view
with an application module. The application runtime establishes this connection
within a composite, synchronizes values, propagates events, invokes module
methods, and manages the module lifecycle.

The runtime provides the infrastructure for connecting views and modules but
does not define the architectural role of a module.

```text
       Runtime
          │
          ▼             
View ◄─────────► Module 
```

Depending on the application architecture, a module may implement a ViewModel,
Controller, Service, Application Model, or another architectural role defined by
the application.

## Application Module
A module is the JavaScript object associated with a composite.

Together with HTML, CSS, and optional additional resources, it forms a module
within an application. Modules provide application-specific data, state, and
interactions for views. Depending on the architecture, they can coordinate
application logic, domain models, or services.

The runtime connects the view with its corresponding module but does not impose
an architectural pattern. Depending on the application, a module can implement
one of many architectural roles, for example:
- ViewModel
- Controller
- Service
- Application Model
- another architectural role defined by the application

Modules can contain presentation logic, coordinate domain models, use other
components and abstractions, invoke services, or manage UI-specific state.

## View
The view defines the user interface and is implemented with HTML markup. It
represents the information and interactions provided by the associated
Application Module according to its own structure. The view is responsible for
presentation and does not define application logic. The Application Runtime
connects and synchronizes the view with the associated Application Module.

## Application Runtime
The runtime provides the infrastructure required to connect views and modules.

Its responsibilities include:
- connecting views with modules,
- synchronizing values between views and modules,
- forwarding UI events,
- rendering and reactive updates,
- routing,
- component management, and
- lifecycle management.

The runtime manages the binding mechanisms between the view and the module. It
provides infrastructure for rendering, synchronization, events, routing, and
lifecycle management, but does not implement application logic or prescribe an
application architecture.

## Composite
A composite is the basis for view-module binding and consists of:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Module)
- optional additional resources

Each composite is identified by its Composite ID, which connects the HTML
element, the corresponding module, and the CSS selector.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="aspect-js.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="example" composite></div>
  </bod>
</html>
```

```javascript
const example = {
    ...    
}
```

```css
#example {
  ...    
}
```

The Composite ID uniquely identifies a composite within the application. It is
formed from the `id` and `composite` attributes of the HTML element and
determines the location of the corresponding module in the global object
hierarchy. A Composite ID consists of letters, digits, and underscores and must
start with a letter or an underscore.

Elements inside the composite that define an `id` correspond to properties of
the module when they are implemented there.

```javascript
const model = {
    message: "Hello", 
    submit: {
        ...    
    }
};
```

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form id="model" composite>
      <input type="text" id="message"/>
      <input type="submit" id="submit"/>
      ...
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Binding
View-Module Binding connects the HTML view with the corresponding module. The
runtime performs event wiring and synchronization based on the binding
configuration.

The runtime:
- synchronizes values,
- forwards UI events,
- invokes module methods, and
- updates the view.

```javascript
const model = {
    message: "Hello", 
    dock() {
        ...
    },
    undock() {
        ...
    },
    submit: {
        onClick(event) {
            ...
        }
    }
};
```

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <form id="model" composite>
      <input type="text" id="message" value="{{model.message}}" events="change"/>
      <input type="submit" id="submit"/>
      ...
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Synchronization
Synchronization transfers values between HTML elements and the corresponding
properties of the module in addition to the static binding. It is triggered
only by the events declared with the `events` attribute.

More details about the usage can be found in chapter [events](markup.md#events).

## Validation
Validation controls whether synchronization of values between the view and the
module is performed. It is declared with the `validate` attribute together with
the `events` attribute. The corresponding validation method is implemented by
the module.

More details about the usage can be found in chapter [validate](
    markup.md#validate).

## Events
The runtime forwards supported HTML events to matching methods of the module.

Events are mapped to methods following a naming convention. Matching methods are
discovered during binding and registered automatically as event listeners. Event
handlers can be resolved from module methods according to the naming convention.

```javascript
const contact = {
    mail: {
        onClick(event) {
          const mail = "mailto:mail@local?subject=Test&body=Greetings";
            document.location.href = mail;
            return false;
        }
    }
};
```

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="contact" composite>
      <p>
        Example for use of events.
      </p>
      <button id="mail">
        Click Me!
      </button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Dock
When a composite becomes part of the DOM, its module is docked and, if
implemented, `dock()` is executed before the composite is rendered. The method
can be used to prepare the view.

```javascript
const model = {
    dock() {
        ...
    }
};
```

## Undock
When a composite is removed from the DOM, its module is undocked, after which
the optional `undock()` method is executed. The method can be used for cleanup.

```javascript
const model = {
    undock() {
        ...
    }
};
```

If a composite is controlled by a condition, docking and undocking depend on the
evaluation of that condition.

## Architectural Patterns
View-Module Binding is independent of the application architecture.

The runtime connects views with their associated modules.

```text
        Runtime
           │
           ▼
View ◄───────────► Module
```

The architectural role of the module depends entirely on its implementation.

### MVC
In MVC, the module typically implements the Controller.


```text
        Runtime
           │
           ▼
View ◄───────────► Module
                     │
          (implements Controller)
                     │
                     ▼
                Domain Model
```

The Controller processes user interactions, coordinates domain models, and
invokes services.

### MVVM
In MVVM, the module typically implements the ViewModel.

```text
        Runtime
           │
           ▼
View ◄───────────► Module
                     │
           (implements ViewModel)
                     │
                     ▼
                Domain Model
```

The ViewModel contains presentation logic, UI state, computed values, and
commands.

Domain data remains part of the Domain Model.

### MVCS
In MVCS, the module typically implements the Controller and delegates
application logic to services.

```text
        Runtime
           │
           ▼
View ◄───────────► Module
                     │
          (implements Controller)
                     │
                     ▼
                  Services
                     │
                     ▼
                Domain Model
```

### Other Architectures
The runtime is independent of any specific architectural pattern.

A module may also implement:
- a Service
- a Application Model
- another architectural role defined by the application

The runtime connects views with their associated modules.

The architectural role of that module is defined solely by the application.
